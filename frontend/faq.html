                                The shipping amount that we charge is solely for the shipping method. Each country’s regulations are different so there is a chance that you may get charged duties or custom fees.

                                You can repeat it on you, but it would still count as a week with me (only under special circumstances will I not count it).

                                Yes, you can add it at any time during your program, but keep in mind it will only last for the duration of your program (at the end of your 12 weeks).

                                It’s normal to feel extra sore when you being a new regimen because your body is not used to so much physical activity. Stretching & foam rolling post workout will help a lot.

                                No, at least drink a protein shake if you can’t stomach food but eventually you should work up to eating a full meal.

                                Once a week preferably on a high carb day. Eat all of your meals as scheduled until you get to your cheat meal, or if you eat it early in the day continue with the rest of your meals after.

                                Absolutely. With spices you don’t need to cut out sodium completely but please be mindful and look for spices with low sodium.

                                You would simply cook the recipe and then measure it out according to the portions that are already in your food plan. i.e. 4oz of Turkey Meatballs instead of 4oz of Chicken.

                                You simply need to refer to the macro breakdowns I’ve provided in the meal plan. Swap carbs for carbs, protein for protein, & fats for other fats.  Veggies are unlimited.
